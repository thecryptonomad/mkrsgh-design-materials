This weekend, we will create fireflies on micro:bit. The firefly individually starts flashing LEDs out of sync, but "inspires" nearby fireflies. Eventually, all the fireflies flash, all at once, in synchrony without a conductor; a phenomenon called "self-synchronization".

In the class, kids will learn communication over radio wave, and a simple, but surprising, algorithm to orchestrate many micro:bits. Fireflies in Southeast Asia use the algorithm, discovered by a group of scientists, to play a stunning light show at night.

Please bring your own laptop (not a tablet). We have limited numbers of laptops for rent. Contact us for availability.

If you have never heard of micro:bit before, this video shows how it helps students develop computational thinking skills.
