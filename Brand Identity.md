## **2\. 🖼️ Visual Identity**

### **✅ LOGO DESIGN**

**Type**: Minimalist / Geometric

A visual composition that seeks to harmonize elements of technology, cultural heritage and the natural environment

Gear (Top): The gear is a universally recognized symbol of engineering, innovation, process, collaboration, and “making” (hence “Makers”). In the context of a coliving, it connotes the idea of ​​a community that creates, innovates, and builds things together.

Angkor Wat Skyline (Center): The inclusion of this element is crucial to anchoring the brand geographically and culturally. It evokes history, beauty, mystery, and the rich heritage of the location, creating an immediate connection to the destination for potential guests.

Microchip/Circuit Board (Left): The presence of the microchip reinforces the concept of “Makers” in the technological and digital sense. It suggests an environment conducive to creative minds, engineers, developers, and digital professionals. This juxtaposition with Angkor Wat creates an interesting contrast between the ancient and the modern, the artisanal and the technological, which is the essence of coliving for a new generation of “digital nomads” and “makers.”

Leaves/Twigs (Base): Botanical elements at the base bring an organic and natural dimension to the design. In Siem Reap, lush nature is an integral part of the experience. They can also convey the idea of ​​growth and development.
