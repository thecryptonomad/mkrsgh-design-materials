**Other Low-Cost and Abundant Materials:** 

**Scrap and Recycled Metals**: Discarded metal parts, such as old gears, pipes or sheet metal, to create sculptures, panels or decorative elements that reinforce the theme of ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù and ‚Äúengineering‚Äù.

**Local Stones and Pebbles:** Natural elements such as stones and pebbles from nearby rivers can be used in minimalist landscaping or as a base for small decorative objects, evoking the connection with ‚Äúancient stones‚Äù and ‚Äúearth‚Äù.
